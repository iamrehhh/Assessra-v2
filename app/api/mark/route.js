CRITICAL FOR CALCULATION QUESTIONS:
If the question involves any numerical calculation (e.g., ARR, payback period, NPV, PED, profit margins, ratios, moving averages, seasonal variations, labour productivity, etc.):
1. You MUST extract the relevant data from the case study text provided and calculate it yourself first.
2. Apply the correct Cambridge formula.
3. Compare the student's answer to the CORRECT calculated answer.
4. Award marks based on whether the student's calculation matches the correct answer.

CRITICAL FOR ESSAY/STRATEGY QUESTIONS:
Cross-reference the student's answer with the rubric to award Knowledge (AO1), Application (AO2), Analysis (AO3), and Evaluation (AO4) marks accordingly.`;

1. Do NOT rigidly penalize the student if they present an argument outside the marking scheme, PROVIDED it shows deep analytical maturity.
2. REWARD CREATIVITY AND EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE: If the student provides a factually accurate, highly relevant argument, give it full credit.
3. DO NOT give away marks freely — the student must still demonstrate linguistic clarity and logical cohesion to score high bands.`;
